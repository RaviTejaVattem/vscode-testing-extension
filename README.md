# Angular Karma test extension for vscode
This is an extension for vscode to view, run, debug and check coverage for the angular tests

Based on new [vscode testing api](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/testing) and inspired by [karma test explorer](https://github.com/lucono/karma-test-explorer).

    - The karma server will now remain active(until the vscode window is closed) and wait for the user action.
- Only after the Karma server is up(port number on statusbar signifies server is active) we can run, debug or check the coverage.

## Work in progress/ yet to be done
- Reduce the CPU utilization.
- Reduce the load time.
- Run tests from run coverage.
- Add more logging and show notifications to the user as required.
- Reliable cancellation of the process and using cancellation tokens appropriately.
- etc .......


## Troubleshooting
- You might notice some delay in the tasks performed by the extension
(Optimization is in progress).
- This extension writes most of the logs to the output channel shown below

- In most cases, reloading the vscode window will solve most of the issues as the servers will be closed and the extension will be reinitialized.
- If you notice 100% cpu utilization, it could be due to having multiple vscode instances open and each will run its own instance of karma server.
